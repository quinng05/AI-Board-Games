# Interactive Board Games with Python and AI
 This repository contains Python-based implementations of interactive board games developed with Pygame, showcasing algorithmic design, GUI development, and AI integration:


Connect 4: Implements game logic and a graphical interface for two-player interaction.

Connect 4 with AI: Features an AI opponent using heuristic scoring for strategic decision-making.

Tic-Tac-Toe (4x4): Extends the traditional game with a larger grid and custom win conditions, highlighting adaptable rule sets.

These projects demonstrate skills in object-oriented programming, real-time user interaction, and algorithm optimization.
